## Description

- In this repository I modified the starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
- Following the requirements, I created the code in JavaScript to powered each option the employee wants to create their password trying to have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
- I commented out any changes made to the code for futures developers understand.


## Instructions

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria to generate their password:

 1. Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)
 2. Character type:
- Special characters
- Numeric characters
- Lowercase characters
- Uppercase characters
